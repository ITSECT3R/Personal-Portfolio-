## Data Model — `Certification` (see `src/types/certification.ts`)

| Field          | Type                            | Role                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | `string`                        | Unique, kebab-case identifier                              |
| `title`        | `string`                        | Certificate display name                                   |
| `issuer`       | `'epam'\|'freecodecamp'\|'aws'` | Issuer brand — drives icon + filter dropdown               |
| `issuedYear`   | `number`                        | Year issued — drives sort order                            |
| `domain`       | `'frontend'\|…`                 | Architecture domain — multi-select dropdown filter         |
| `technologies` | `string[]`                      | **Must match TECH_ICON_MAP keys**. Drives tech badge icons |
| `description`  | `string`                        | 1-2 sentence summary shown on the card                     |
| `link`         | `string`                        | External URL to the certificate                            |

### `Domain` values

```
'frontend' | 'backend' | 'fullstack' | 'testing' | 'devops' | 'cloud'
```

Add new values by extending the `CertificationDomain` union in `src/types/certification.ts`
and adding a label to `DOMAIN_LABEL_MAP` in `src/utils/certificationLabels.ts`.

---

## Data-Driven Filter Convention

All filters (issuer, domain, technologies) are fully data-driven — the `useCertificationFilters`
hook derives available options from the actual `certificationList` data,
mirroring the `useProjectFilters` pattern exactly.

```ts
const allIssuers = useMemo(
  () =>
    (
      [
        ...new Set(certificationList.map(c => c.issuer)),
      ] as CertificationIssuer[]
    ).sort((a, b) => ISSUER_LABEL_MAP[a].localeCompare(ISSUER_LABEL_MAP[b])),
  []
);
```

**Consequence:** Adding a new certification to any data file automatically adds
its issuer, domain, and technologies to the filter dropdowns.
**No filter code, component, or CSS ever needs to change.**

### Adding a new certification

1. Add an entry to the appropriate file under `src/data/common/certifications/`
2. All downstream consumers (CV page, Skills page, filters) update automatically

### Adding a new issuer (e.g. `'google'`)

1. Add `'google'` to the `CertificationIssuer` union in `src/types/certification.ts`
2. Add `google: 'Google'` to `ISSUER_LABEL_MAP` in `src/utils/certificationLabels.ts`
3. Add the brand icon to `src/components/common/icons/brands.tsx`
4. Add `google: GoogleIcon` to `ISSUER_ICON_MAP` in `src/utils/issuerIcons.tsx`
5. Create `src/data/common/certifications/googleCertifications.ts` with at least one cert
6. Import and spread into `certificationList` in the barrel `index.tsx`

---

## Filter Logic

- **All filters** — multi-select dropdowns; **OR logic** — a cert passes if it matches
  _at least one_ of the selected values. Empty selection = no restriction.
- **Sort** — Newest/Oldest toggle, applied after filtering. Sorts by `issuedYear`.
- `MultiSelectDropdown` is the same generic component used by the Projects section.
- Filter state lives in `useCertificationFilters`; filter logic in `filterCertifications.ts`.

---

## Certifications — Single Source of Truth

Certification data is defined **once** under `src/data/common/certifications/`.
Both the CV page and the Skills page derive their display data from the same
canonical `certificationList` array.

```
canonical: Certification[]
    │
    ├── groupCertificationsByIssuer()  →  CV page  (grouped by issuer, with brand icons)
    │
    └── useCertificationFilters()      →  Skills page  (flat, filterable, sortable)
```

The CV page's grouped format is derived by `src/utils/groupCertificationsByIssuer.tsx`.
It is exported from the barrel `index.tsx` as `certifications` so the CV page
doesn't need to call the utility itself.

---

## Skills Grid

The skills grid reuses `skills.ts` data that the CV sidebar already consumes.
Each skill group renders as a bordered card with `TECH_ICON_MAP`-backed badges.
`softSkills` are rendered separately as a plain chip list below the grid.

### Border assignation per category

```
programmingSkills    → border-dual-spin
frontendSkills       → border-rainbow
backendAndDatabase   → border-gradient
testingAndQA         → border-shimmer
devOpsAndCICD        → border-pulse
cloudPlatforms       → border-dual-spin
developmentTools     → border-light-trail
```

---

## TECH_ICON_MAP key conventions

The `TECH_ICON_MAP` in `src/components/common/icons/tech.tsx` is the single
registry for technology icons. Keys must **exactly match** the strings used in:

- `skills.ts` skill arrays
- Certification `technologies[]` arrays
- Project `languages[]` and `technologies[]` arrays

Common mismatches to avoid:

- `NodeJs` → use `Node.js`
- `WebDriver IO` → use `WebDriverIO`
- `Eslint` → use `ESLint`

Technologies not present in the map render as a text-only fallback badge.
